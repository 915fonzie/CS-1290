Chapter 2 Question 2.2

Implement an algorithm to find the kth to last element of a singly linked list.

IDEAL and Duke's 7 Steps combined

I - Find the kth to last element within a singly linked list.

D - return a single element from a linked list.

E - The possible solution that I want to implement is the same with a similar question that Iâ€™ve answered
    where I use two pointers to track the kth value.

A - If the pointers are placed in the correct spot after checking for the kth value, the outcome should result
    in the return of the value of kth.

L - I did not implement the entire class to test the method, but I did use leetcode.com with a similar question
    and the result was the return of the kth value.
