Chapter 2 Question 2.6

Implement a function to check if a linked list is a palindrome.

IDEAL and Duke's 7 Steps combined

I - Check if a Linked list is a palindrome.

D - Return either true or false depending on whether the Linked list is a palindrome or not.

E - One possible solution that I thought of was using a stack to check the list.
    Looking a little deeper, Since we’re given the length of the list, I will attempt
    to store half the list in the stack and compare the second part of the list with 
    the stored stack by popping the stack and check if the stack is empty at the end.

A - If I’m able to implement the code correctly, the outcome should be a return 
    statement of either true or false if the Link list is a palindrome.

L - From looking at my solution and hand tracing for edge cases, the result appears 
    accurate and I believe Big O is O(N) for time complexity and 0(N) for space 
    complexity as well.
