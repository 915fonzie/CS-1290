Chapter 2 Question 2.1

Write code to remove duplicates from an unsorted linked list.
Follow up
How would you solve this problem if a temporary buffer is not allowed?


IDEAL and Duke's 7 Steps combined

I - Remove duplicates from an unsorted linked list

D - Doesn't necessarily ask to return anything but, I would return the unsorted linked list after duplicates have been removed.

E - If I still don't consider the follow up to the question, I can go ahead and use a hashset to interate between the linked list and remove the duplicates in one run.

A - I expect there to be only unique characters stored into the HashSet and to be able to return the linked list with no duplicates.

L - Was not able to work it out without a buffer at the moment (will try at a later time), but both time and space complexity in this solution is 0(N) and appears to work.
