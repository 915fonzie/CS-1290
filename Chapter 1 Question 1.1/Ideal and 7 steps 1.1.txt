Chapter 1 Question 1.1

IDEAL and Duke's 7 Steps combined

I - Check whether String input is unique or not

D - Return either true or false depending on whether the String is unique or not

E - Since asking for unique characters on a single String input, if I consider using a HashSet to check for duplicate characters, 
    I can use a single for-loop to check each character and see if it's contained within the HashSet or not.

A - If using a boolean method, the outcome should be either true or false.

L - After checking my solution with edge cases, the solution appears accurate.
